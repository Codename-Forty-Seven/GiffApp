Application using REST api + Kotlin

The application allows you to view and interact with GIFs in a convenient format. On the main screen, the user sees a list or table of GIF animations that are loaded gradually, in pages. It is possible to quickly search by keywords by simply entering a query from the keyboard.

Even without an Internet connection, the user can view previously downloaded images thanks to the caching function: files are stored in the device's internal storage, and links to them are stored in the local database. If necessary, you can delete any image, and it will no longer be displayed in the list, even after retrieving data from the server again.

The second screen is designed to view the selected GIF in full screen mode. Convenient navigation is also available - the user can scroll through other images by simply swiping horizontally across the screen.
